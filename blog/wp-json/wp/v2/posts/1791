A Guide for Everything You Need to Know"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>Ever wanted to learn about web development or app development? Then you probably came across <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JavaScript<\/a> (JS).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s an open-source programming language that can make a developer&#8217;s life easy. It lets you develop amazing features and use frameworks for your app, all with just one language.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/3-languages-you-should-know-to-become-a-website-developer\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1998\">web developers, <\/a>JS offers a one-for-all solution, but one of its most popular uses is adding some liveliness to the website. Simply put, JS makes websites interactive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But JavaScript is more than that \u2013 this powerful language has many uses. This is a popular programming language among both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/difference-between-front-end-back-end-programming\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1306\">frontend and backend developers<\/a>. And there are many frameworks available in JS too. So what is JS? And what is it used for?\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s explore everything you need to know about JavaScript!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So, What is JS?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before going into the details, here\u2019s the simplest definition of what JS is:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>It\u2019s a text-based programming language that can add interactivity to your website.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most web transitions and animations use JavaScript and it complements the structural and stylistic elements of languages like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/add-css-to-html\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1262\">CSS and HTML.\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What that means is, that JS works with HTML elements to increase the interactivity of the website. Also, by creating any special effects to show feedback JavaScript increases user engagement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;But \u2013 JavaScript is not only for the frontend. It\u2019s a client-side as well as a server-side object-oriented programming language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>JavaScript \u2013 A Brief History<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript has a unique history. It\u2019s one of the longest-running and growing coding languages in the history of the Internet. In the early 1990s, JS was developed in response to static web pages. These pages lacked interactivity and only showed content without reloading it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early browsing pioneer Netscape took it on themselves to create a fun language. They developed JavaScript to add interactive and dynamic elements to web pages. The language continued to grow and spread with the development of modern browsers. These browsers are responsible for showing the data and sites on your screen!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Can We Use JavaScript?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While JavaScript can make websites interactive, it can do a lot more than that. JavaScript can be used to create software, manage servers, and control embedded hardware. In short, after learning JS, you can experiment with other areas of development too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprised? Let\u2019s dive a little deeper.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Web Interactivity and Front-End<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript is mainly used on the client-side of the website. It\u2019s so popular that almost<a href=\"https:\/\/w3techs.com\/technologies\/details\/cp-javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> 98.0% of web applications use JavaScript on the client-side.<\/a> It works with HTML and CSS to turn static pages into dynamic websites. For example, if you want to add a modal (usually used to show content like a popup in front of all other content), on a button click, JavaScript is the solution. Or if you want smooth navigation for the side menu, use JS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript is a great way to add fun elements to your project. You can use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/10-basics-of-javascript\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"2000\">JavaScript to add some cool transitions or animations to your website<\/a>. Another awesome feature of JS is the ability to add content to the website without reloading it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mobile Apps<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s still used for websites is still popular, mobile apps have stepped up their game too. The good news? You can use JavaScript to develop mobile applications, though OS-specific coding languages like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-is-swift-code-all-your-questions-answered\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1194\">Swift <\/a>and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/java-vs-javascript\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1635\">Java <\/a>are more common.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript is a great mobile app development tool! React Native is one amazing JS framework for building mobile apps for both OS and Android.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Games<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript is a great programming language for building 2D or 3D games for web browsers. It has tons of libraries like Pixi.js to ease the process of game development. Phaser.js is another popular game development library. You can get coding in no time with these easy-to-use libraries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Server-Side Development<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript, while a crucial part of Front-End web development, has made its way to the backend as well. A JavaScript-based framework, Node.js, is a popular tool in backend development. With the help of Node.js, you can create and configure web servers to interact with the Front-End.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Machine Learning<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since technology is evolving, AI is the talk of the town these days. You can use JavaScript to do wonders in this area as well. JavaScript offers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/a-guide-to-data-science-machine-learning-deep-learning-and-artificial-intelligence\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1430\">machine learning <\/a>libraries like Tensorflow.js to create models. Developers can use the library for future predictions, analyzing patterns, and much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Confused?
