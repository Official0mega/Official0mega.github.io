Many new coding languages (for developing applications) have been created to solve different problems. For these coding languages, companies need a specialist to make things work. That\u2019s why the number of aspiring software engineers is increasing more than ever.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But knowing their code is not enough, what do Software Engineers do? What even <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a Software engineer? Can you become a Software engineer after only<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/software-engineers-vs-software-developers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">learning to code<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Let\u2019s jump in and explore all these questions!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Software Engineers \u2013 Who Are they?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software engineers aren\u2019t just coders. It\u2019s a broad term that refers to hundreds of different qualities and unique skill sets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A software engineer is involved in the whole life cycle of software development. From the initial phase to the delivery of the app, software engineers are there. Companies need them from requirement gathering to the maintenance of apps. (Requirement gathering refers to the initial activity in which clients tell their expectations)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software engineers need to be able to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Code<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Design apps<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use methodologies to develop apps.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They also need to wear different hats according to different roles.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a lead, they need to manage the team, deliver outcomes, and be productive. Even entry-level software engineers may do client interactions, documentation (for software), and coding.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And in the middle of all of that, they\u2019re honing their coding skills for more senior roles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what is a software engineer? To sum it up, software engineers are developers, managers, and architects. They are specialists in their fields. And they constantly work to level up their skills further.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What do Software Engineers do?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although software engineers have to be in all phases of development, what do they actually do?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, a software engineer uses math and logic to build applications. That includes websites, desktop apps, mobile apps, and much more. For example, Google is developed by a team of amazing engineers and other specialists. They create everything that you use connected to technology and the Internet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But software engineer is just an umbrella term to define their job. There are many different aspects of software engineering. Their tasks and specialties depend on the type of software they build. Some software they\u2019ve built include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operating systems like Windows, macOS, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/programming-languages-used-to-make-video-games\/\">Computer games<\/a>, whether simple browser-based games or more complex ones.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Video games including VR functionality<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Websites<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business applications<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI applications<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile apps<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apps for data science and analytics<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apps for IoT (internet of things). For example, apps for controlling an electronic device<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just to be clear, one software engineer can&#8217;t work in every area.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a broad categorization of areas that engineers can work in. Usually, an engineer follows a path to specialize in developing a specific app. This is because software engineering relies on knowing a variety of programming languages. Each language is tailored to produce dynamic and responsive apps for a unique use case.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>What Does a Software Engineer\u2019s Job Usually Involve?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A regular day in the life of a software engineer consists of a lot of coding. These experts spend most of their time working at a computer, solving tech problems. They have to supervise tasks, code and cooperate with colleagues to fix issues. Software engineers sometimes invest hours correcting old code and maintaining it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another responsibility is the development of modules for clients and businesses. These modules define the initial structure of the project. That\u2019s why they may identify customer requirements and build modules as per their needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software engineers don&#8217;t constantly operate alone as most people think.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, they work with project directors, user UI or UX designers, data analysts, and others. What does their day-to-day life look like? Well\u2026:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mostly software engineers gather requirements from clients. They refine these requirements along with business analysts before proceeding.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A software engineer develops the foundation of the code. They decide the structure of the application. At the same time, they make sure they are keeping further maintenance in mind. They also collaborate with software architects to create initial system designs. System design means they\u2019ve to decide on technologies or the approach they should follow.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A senior software engineer usually reviews peer codes as well. That means that when a junior colleague writes code, they review the code and make sure there is no bug. Even if there is no bug, they also have to ensure coding standards. These coding standards may vary according to the organization. They usually involve clean code, that\u2019s maintainable and follows best practices<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A software engineer is also responsible for testing code. They work with dedicated QA colleagues (who are mostly software engineers as well), to find bugs. And they perform beta testing routinely.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with development, software engineers do maintenance as well. For example, if there is an old application or an already built application, they maintain it. Maintenance means they perform routine analysis and add modern features. They also remove previous bugs, if any. Sometimes, if an app is old, they may have to shift the entire code to another language too.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But\u2026 that\u2019s not all. A software engineer also hires other software engineers. They need to interview people and hire them accordingly. They collaborate with higher management regarding clients and new hires.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some specific developer roles? Let\u2019s look at a few popular software development positions and what you could expect working in them:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Backend Web Developer working for a small business or startup<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collaborate with the front-end developers, managers, or other developers to resolve API issues. APIs are usually a way to transfer data between two ends.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Develop and maintain secure web services. These services are used in apps to process transactions and much more.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build reusable code and libraries for future use or updates.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check and resolve bugs that are critical to the application&#8217;s user experience.

Also, if it needs scaling, redesign the whole infrastructure.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are just examples of the career paths available to software engineers. Other popular and in-demand jobs for software developers and engineers include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web developer<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mobile Developer<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality Assurance (QA) engineer<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Systems Engineer<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Machine learning engineer<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Database administrator<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>What Skills or Mental Abilities Does a Good Software Engineer Have?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like technical skills, soft skills also play a key role in making anyone successful. And the same goes for software engineering. Software engineers must possess great interpersonal skills to be successful. They are regularly interacting with clients and peers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0That\u2019s why they have to be great at both coding and talking. Let\u2019s review a few skills you need to develop to be a great professional:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Communication Skills:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Software engineers do not operate in a bubble. They must be great at communicating. They should convey their concerns, stand up for what\u2019s right, and listen to requirements. Observing how a senior engineer interacts with clients is a good way to develop these skills.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Professionalism:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Coding is often romanticized as something opposite of a traditional business setting. But the reality is much less exciting. Many of your clients will be corporations or brick-and-mortar businesses. Professionalism is key to proving to your client that you respect their business. So that they can realize that you\u2019re worth their time and money.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><b>Willingness to learn:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is an extremely important skill for software engineers. Software engineers have to learn constantly, and they must be willing to learn. They must be attentive to details and have the hunger to learn.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Open-mindedness: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A software engineer must take constructive criticism easily. It doesn\u2019t mean that they shouldn\u2019t mention when they\u2019re right. Instead, they must have what it takes to reflect on their own work and learn new ways. Since technology is a constantly developing field, they should be able to adapt too.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Flexibility:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Things will go wrong, and clients will change their minds. Your team members may join or leave while developing a single application. Being able to roll with the changes is essential for software developers. Not only for performing your job well but also for preserving your sanity.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>What Do I Need to Learn to Be a Software Engineer?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can develop soft skills over time, especially when working with seniors and other colleagues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what\u2019s the fastest way for <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to become a software engineer<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">?
