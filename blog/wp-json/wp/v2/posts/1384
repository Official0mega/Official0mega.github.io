As an open source language developed within the Apache 2.0 license, Kotlin integrates both object-oriented and functional programming features. Kotlin additionally possesses the support of all major Java IDEs such as Android Studio, Eclipse, and NetBeans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some additional specific benefits that Kotlin offers developers:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is significantly easier for developers to switch from Java to Kotlin.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kotlin includes intuitive extension functions to help developers build clean APIs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It has null included within its type system. Nullability problems are a frequent source of frustration when coding with Java. Since Android often uses null to represent the absence of a value. Kotlin offers a solution by placing null directly in its type system.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kotlin is more clean and concise than Java at a structural level, which can help remove opportunities for errors.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adopting Kotlin does not require any money, which makes it ideal for startups or individuals working with limited (or non-existent) budgets<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kotlin is compatible with all Java libraries and frameworks, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), and can be integrated with Gradle or Maven build systems.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><strong>How Do These Benefits Help Kotlin Compared To Java?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First off, anyone with some familiarity with Java can easily switch to Kotlin and take advantage of the structural benefits of the newer language. Adaptation is also free, which makes it even easier. Kotlin offers a much faster and more creative Android app development process than Java.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As developers have compared the two languages\u2019 security features over the years, the development community has concluded that Kotlin is more secure with a much smaller chance of crashes. Additionally, Kotlin is more flexible and it offers more options and solutions, which can help to reduce the number of lines written (and with less lines, less chance for bugs or errors to appear).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kotlin looks and feels slightly different than Java while writing and reading it, but the functionality operates in largely the same way. Simply put, Kotlin is 100% compatible with existing Java code. Kotlin\u2019s core purpose is interoperability. Developers can simply write modules in Kotlin, which works flawlessly within existing Java code. By eliminating the Bytecode, a Kotlin compiler allows two languages to work in unison in the same project.&nbsp; Because of the interoperability of the two languages, Kotlin allows developers to import their favorite tools and frameworks from Java, while also having access to some of the structural benefits of Kotlin which enhance speed and decrease the chance for errors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experienced developers know that creating too many threads in your code can slow down a program. However, in Kotlin multi-threading is a feature which allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU. Each part of such a program is called a thread. Because of this design structure, Kotlin can help maintain application speed (and thus, a better user experience).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How Does Kotlin Compare To Python?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Python has assumed the mantle of one of the most popular programming languages in the world today, people naturally also compare Kotlin to Python. While the languages are more different than Kotlin and Java, there are some unique benefits to Kotlin which Python doesn\u2019t offer developers:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Python often receives much credit for being easier to learn and use for newer developers, the truth is that the lack of a unifying philosophy\/theory behind the language actually makes the language fairly messy. While Kotlin requires a bit more programming knowledge and experience to learn, the language itself is a bit more intuitive and cleaner than Python.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are some frameworks like Kivy for Python mobile development, Kotlin is far superior for building mobile applications (which makes sense given its design specifically for building within Android).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python suffers a bit from \u201clanguage fragmentation\u201d, since a good chunk of Python developers still uses the older Python 2 implementation (and which can lead to different \u201ctypes\u201d of Python apps). Kotlin has a more unified implementation, driven by JetBrains\u2019 continued active role in further developing the language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python offers limited support for functional programming, which also limits its usability in certain cases. Additionally, unlike Kotlin, who\u2019s multithreading features are a point of celebration among developers, Python\u2019s multithreading process often introduces unwanted complexity (and can lead to errors or slower operations).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python is also less interoperable than Kotlin, with \u201cPython-specific practices\u201d that are not always transferable to coding with other languages.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Who and What Uses Kotlin?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a language that was created only a decade ago, Kotlin has a remarkably wide base of users and use cases already. As you can imagine for a language geared toward Android app development, Google is a major supporter of Kotlin, with over sixty Google-based apps written using the language (most notably, Maps and Drive). Other names using Kotlin for their tech stacks include a who\u2019s who of major tech brands, such as:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robinhood<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tinder<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amazon<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shazam<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rocket Travel<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pivotal<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Square<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basecamp<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pinterest<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coursera<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trello<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Uber<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Netflix<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trivago<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delivery Hero<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitpanda<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to Android mobile apps, a growing number of developers are also using Kotlin for web back-end. Based on a JetBrains survey of developers in 2020, 56% of those polled indicated they were using Kotlin for mobile apps, 47% for back-end, and just over a third had migrated to Kotlin from another language.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the stats and user testimonials, Kotlin is also often lauded for being an industry-based programming language (as opposed to one that was developed within academia or with a research basis). This means that productivity and operability were central to its design, which also lends itself well to solving industry problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Why Should You Consider Learning Kotlin?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For years, people often pointed to Python as the language for new programmers to learn, because of the intuitive design and easier syntax than some others. However, as we noted above, Python has some issues under the hood that can actually make it tougher for programmers to master as they get into more advanced programs and building processes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In contrast to that, Kotlin can be both paired with Java or learned by itself, and can allow newer programmers to master a language that has some significant structural benefits that we outlined above. By taking online coding classes and learning Kotlin, you can develop apps for mobile, back-end, and even for some newer fields of tech, including machine learning and the Internet of Things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SoloLearn offers a great method for newer developers who want to learn the fundamentals of Kotlin, and begin to use it for their own projects:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A comprehensive Kotlin tutorial, that will walk you through all of the essentials you need to know about the language and its capabilities<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coding challenges and quizzes that allow you to test your Kotlin content knowledge using actual code and real-world scenarios<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A thriving learner community that allows you to network, learn alongside, and even compete with fellow Kotlin learners to help keep you motivated<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An ever-growing code playground that allows you to experiment with live Kotlin code and begin building small projects before you move on to your own ideas<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A dedicated user profile that lets you track learning achievements, set learning goals, and demonstrate your mastery of Kotlin to fellow learners or, eventually, potential employers looking to hire you for a Kotlin programming job<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Among the new \u201cit\u201d programming languages, there are few names getting as much press and chatter as Kotlin.
