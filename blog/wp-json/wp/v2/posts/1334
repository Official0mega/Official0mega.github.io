What kinds of questions can you expect? In this list, we break down 10 common questions asked of candidates for jobs involving JavaScript programming.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if your prospective job title isn\u2019t \u201cJavaScript developer\u201d, many frontend and backend developers are expected to be familiar with the language. So before the big day, look over our list and be ready to answer these 10 JavaScript questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. What\u2019s the difference between Java and JavaScript?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This question can easily separate JavaScript pros from those who only have a passing familiarity with it. Even though they share a name, Java and JavaScript are two entirely different programming languages with separate histories and use cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Java was first developed by Sun Microsystems. Java programs are designed to be platform-independent, since they use a runtime called a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to execute their code. Java isn\u2019t a scripting language, however, so programs do need to be compiled into bytecode programs prior to execution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JavaScript, on the other hand, is a scripting language. Its programs don\u2019t need to be compiled \u2014 they can be run as-is by an interpreter on any platform with a supported implementation.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JavaScript was developed by Netscape for use in its web browser, and was eventually adopted by virtually all web browsers to support dynamic web pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. What are some key features of JavaScript?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the key features of JavaScript you should know about include:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>It is a lightweight interpreted language <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; JavaScript is designed to use little resources, and JavaScript programs don\u2019t need to be compiled.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>It is designed to be network-centric<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; JavaScript was created originally to provide a dynamic experience on web pages. Because of that, it has many features that make it ideal for creating programs that depend on communicating across a network.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>It is an open language<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; JavaScript is based on the open-source ECMAScript standard, which is regularly updated to ensure that implementations across browsers and OSes have access to the latest language features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>It is cross-platform<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Since JavaScript is a scripting language, most programs can be run without modification on any platform with a compatible JavaScript implementation. Frameworks like Node.js bring this interoperability to server-side applications as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/api.sololearn.com\/Uploads\/JavaScript_Interview_Questions_blogpost_2.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cJavaScript\"><\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. How is JavaScript used in frontend web development?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this question, you may be asked how you could improve a web page or create a better user experience by using JavaScript on the frontend.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, you could validate a form field as the user types, and only activate the submit button if the fields are correctly formatted. This could check that an email address is entered in the right field, or that a password is the correct length. This reduces the wait time for the user compared to if they had to submit the form all at once.<\/span><strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JavaScript can also be used to create dynamic, interactive web interfaces. Using JavaScript and CSS, you can create drag and drop components, sliders, animations, and lots of other interface components that users have come to expect from their web experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. Name some JavaScript frameworks and libraries.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JavaScript has been extended and adapted to make it even easier to create rich web applications. Even if you\u2019re applying for more of a generalist position, you could come across some of these JavaScript frameworks in your work. So you should be familiar with what they are and what they\u2019re used for, at least on a basic level.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Node.js<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a powerful platform that allows backend applications to be written in JavaScript and executed on the server side. It is behind many of today\u2019s scalable web applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Angular<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a popular JavaScript frontend framework. It allows developers to create dynamic web interfaces easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Express<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a web application framework for Node.js, used for backend development.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>React<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is another frontend framework similar to Angular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>jQuery<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a JavaScript library that simplifies access to the HTML DOM (document object model) for creating dynamic websites.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. Is JavaScript case sensitive?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you\u2019ve aced the first few questions about JavaScript\u2019s history and use cases, you may be asked some more detailed questions about JavaScript syntax and structure. These questions will gauge your experience with the language as well as your attention to detail.<\/span><strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A simple question about syntax is \u201cIs JavaScript case sensitive?\u201d The short answer is yes, JavaScript functions, variables and objects are case sensitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, \u201cmyVariable\u201d, \u201cmyvariable\u201d and \u201cMyVariable\u201d are all different variables in JavaScript.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, variable names must start with a letter or the underscore character \u201c_\u201d \u2014 they cannot start with a number. For example, \u201c_Variable123\u201d or \u201cvariable123\u201d are valid, while \u201c123Variable\u201d is not.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>6. What data types does JavaScript support?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JavaScript supports the following basic data types:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Boolean<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, e.g. True or False<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>String<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 a collection of non-numeric characters<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Symbol<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 a new primitive type that returns a globally unique identifier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Number<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 an integer<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Object<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, JavaScript has the following special data types:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Undefined<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 a variable or property that doesn\u2019t exist or hasn\u2019t been assigned yet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Null<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u2014 a value that can be assigned to a variable representing no value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, it\u2019s good to know that JavaScript is dynamically typed. This means that, if possible, these data types are automatically converted to each other when it makes sense. For example, the + operator will concatenate a string and a number, without needing to explicitly convert the number to a string., e.g. \u201cYour number is: \u201c + 4<\/span><strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><strong>7. What\u2019s the purpose of the \u2018This\u2019 operator?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an object-oriented programming language, JavaScript makes extensive use of objects. This is especially useful when traversing the HTML DOM.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \u201cthis\u201d keyword in JavaScript refers to the object it belongs to. For example, in a method inside an object, \u201cthis\u201d refers to the owner object. So the function \u201creturnProperty\u201d could use \u201cthis.propertyName\u201d to return the property \u201cpropertyName\u201d belonging to the parent object.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In HTML event handlers, \u201cthis\u201d means the HTML object that received the event. For example, the \u201conclick\u201d event for a button could specify \u201cthis.style.display=\u2019none\u2019\u201d. When the button is clicked, its display would be set to None, effectively removing the button from the page.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>8. What is the difference between \u201c==\u201d and \u201c===\u201d comparison operators?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a more advanced syntax question, which also tests your attention to detail. You probably are familiar with the \u201c==\u201d comparison operator, meaning \u201cequal to\u201d. As we mentioned, JavaScript is dynamically typed, so it will automatically convert variables into types that can be compared, if possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \u201c===\u201d operator compares variables <\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">without<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> type conversion. So comparing a number variable to a string containing a number would work with ==, but not with ===.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 == \u201c3\u201d \/\/true<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 === \u201c3\u201d \/\/false<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>9. Explain the difference between Null, Undefined, Undeclared, and NaN in JavaScript<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any of these values could result in errors in your program \u2014 either runtime errors, where your code refuses to run, or unexpected results in your program\u2019s output. Understanding the difference between them can help you to debug your JavaScript code more quickly.<\/span><strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Null<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable to represent a null, or no value.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Undefined<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> means that a variable has been declared, but no value, and thus no type, has been assigned to it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Undeclared<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> means that a variable has not been declared in the program, and thus doesn\u2019t exist. Attempting to call an undeclared variable will result in a runtime error.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>NaN<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> stands for \u201cnot a number\u201d. If a variable of another type is not able to be converted into a number, NaN is returned instead. NaN always returns \u201cfalse\u201d when compared with a number variable, including itself, so it can be used in functions and methods where a number should be returned but isn\u2019t due to an error.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>10. What will this code output? 3 + 5 + \u201c7\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During a JavaScript interview, you may be shown various snippets of code and be asked what should be the expected output. This tests both your attention to detail and your knowledge of the various quirks of the programming language.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One popular example of the \u201cwhat does this output\u201d question is this one \u2014 add three numbers together, but one of them is in quotation marks. If you guessed that this outputs \u201c15\u201d, then you\u2019d be wrong! The correct answer is 87. This is because the + operator, when used with a string, means \u201cconcatenate\u201d. So this code really says \u201cadd three and five, then concatenate the result with a string\u201d.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course in the real world, having code like this would be confusing, but as a knowledge test, it\u2019s quite effective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these 10 top JavaScript interview questions and answers, you\u2019ll be ready to take on the next phase in your coding job search.
