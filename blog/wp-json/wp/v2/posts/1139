Some programmers may even consider both and end up doing freelance programming and working as part-time employees too.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While most of us like the idea of being our own boss, freelancing isn\u2019t for everyone. Simply put, it isn\u2019t easy to become a successful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/how-to-think-like-a-programmer\/\">freelance programmer.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, if you follow these tips and work consistently, freelance programming can be extremely rewarding. You can be your boss by working on your commitments, vacation whenever you feel like it, and working from anywhere in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are our top 9 tips on becoming a freelance programmer.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>1.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Be Your Boss<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being your own boss sounds interesting, but\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That doesn\u2019t \u201conly\u201d mean working at your own time and pace. Being your boss also means you have to report to yourself. You have to take ownership of your work. You have to focus on the tasks and handle clients too. Everything you expect of a boss needs to be done by freelancers. Think of it as running your own small business and connecting with clients.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But with a little effort, management, and consistency, you can do it!&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you boss yourself around?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try planning your week and manage things depending on their urgency. If you have easier tasks, you can choose to do them earlier. On the other hand, some projects may need more attention and time. That\u2019s why planning the week you picture your situation as a whole. Prioritize the tasks that you need to do right away and check which tasks can wait until later.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>2.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Establish an Online Presence<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelancers are a bit different from remote employees. They\u2019re not conventional employees. They work for a certain period on a task or project, with a company or individual. They often seek out a client on their own, work for them, and move towards other tasks and clients. In some cases, a well-established freelancer can hire people to seek clients for them too.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best ways of getting clients is to establish an online presence.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how do you start getting noticed online?&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create a profile on a freelance programming site and upload your portfolio. Also, you can try being active on sites like LinkedIn. Also, ask your clients to give testimonials and market yourself through word-of-mouth.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also create a website. Sell your skills there and list your previous projects too! You can link <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-is-github\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"2607\">Github<\/a> (a popular site to publish your projects and their code) and LinkedIn there too.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>3.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Prioritize, Manage, Repeat<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After joining the freelance world, you\u2019ll be tempted to do all the work you can. You won\u2019t always calculate your time or capacity. But, trying to do everything at once can burn you out.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overburdening yourself may lead to missed deadlines and commitments. Since you need to face clients yourself, it\u2019s hard if they give a bad review.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s the first rule of prioritization?&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never take on more than you can chew. as a freelancer. Remember, you are your boss and marketer. That\u2019s why learn to say \u201cNo\u201d when it is required of you to do so.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>4.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Avoid Taking Large Projects<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelance programming can be hard because you\u2019re a lone warrior. You have to manage the whole project alone. So avoid accepting projects that can take months or years and avoid taking on projects that are too hard to deliver. Even if you\u2019re confident in your skills, projects that are too large can become hectic and tiring.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happens if a large project is unavoidable?&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But somehow, if you find yourself in such a situation, try talking to your client. Be transparent and tell them your expectations. Then, divide the project into small milestones. That way, both you and your client will know how the project is progressing.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>5.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Read And Understand the Job Description Carefully<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before saying \u201cyes\u201d to a project, understand the requirements. Often, freelancers are in a hurry to get projects. They don\u2019t take the time to read what the client wants and expects. It\u2019s essential to respond on time, but you should give an honest response.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you get a project, if you don\u2019t meet the client\u2019s expectations you can lose them later. You may even lose some great future clients due to a previous client\u2019s bad review.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>6.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Stay Connected to Your Clients<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever happens, communicate with your clients. More than often, they\u2019ll understand your situation. If you\u2019ll keep them in the loop, they\u2019ll be accommodating too. For example, if a deliverable is going to be late, inform them. Or if there is a better approach to do a certain task, explain it to them.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t forget that programming is a technical domain. It\u2019s a mysterious world to most, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re coming to you. You need to make them understand what\u2019s going on in simple words.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are some ways I can stay connected more easily?<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Explain what\u2019s going on with the project. Ensure that there is no issue of visibility between you and the client. Also, if there is a question, respond quickly. Your communication skills can take you far in your career.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>7.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Good Relationships with Clients<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work honestly and stay available for your clients. Show that you\u2019ve got what it takes to complete the project and that you\u2019re excited about working with them. Your client chose <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a reason, so prove that you\u2019re a great choice! That way even in the future, they\u2019ll love to work with you.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some clients are wonderful; others are\u2026well, awful. Finding wonderful clients and communicating with them is an important skill. Even the world&#8217;s most gifted coders can only develop that skill with practice. So don\u2019t go over the top but show your enthusiasm.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do I keep an awesome client?<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clients will love working with programmers they\u2019ve worked with before. They know their skills and knowledge that they\u2019re the right choice. But that will happen only if you\u2019ve maintained a good relationship with them. Once the project ends, reach out from time to time and keep the lines of communication open.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>8.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Self-Discipline<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, companies are hiring people from all over the world. They seek out individuals that can work in their way and take ownership of tasks. In short, individuals with \u201cself-discipline\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s vital to focus on self-discipline to be successful in freelance programming. Learn how to manage your work and schedule things accordingly. This invaluable skill will benefit you a lot in your career.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One great way to achieve self-discipline is by setting up a list of tasks for the day. Once you\u2019re done with them, reward yourself!<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>9.&nbsp;<\/b><b>Build Your Skills<\/b><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tech is an ever-evolving world.
