What the h**l is a Data Warehouse?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Data Warehouse (DWH) is a large, centralized repository of data that is used to support business intelligence activities, such as reporting, data analysis, and decision making. Think of it like a giant library of data, where all the information is organized and easily accessible for anyone who needs it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data warehouses are important because they provide a single source of truth for an organization&#8217;s data, allowing for more accurate and consistent reporting and analysis. They also make it easier to access and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-does-a-data-analyst-do\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"2367\">analyze large amounts of data<\/a>, which can help organizations make better, data-driven decisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll explain what a data warehouse is, how it differs from a database, and why it&#8217;s important. We&#8217;ll also discuss the main components of a data warehouse, the benefits of using one, and how it works. Whether you&#8217;re a coder, engineer, data professional, or just someone who wants to learn more about data warehousing, this article is for you. So let&#8217;s get started!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Differences between DataLake and DataWarehouse<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Data Lake is like a big pool of raw data, where all the data is stored in its original format, without any structure or organization. Think of it like a giant box of assorted Lego bricks, where you can find all kinds of different pieces, but you have to dig through them to find what you need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a DataWarehouse is like a neatly organized Lego set, where all the pieces are sorted and labeled, making it easier to find and use the ones you need. In a DataWarehouse, the data is structured, organized, and cleaned, making it easier to access and analyze .A data warehouse can be compared to a library, where books are collected from different sources, organized by categories and topics, stored on shelves, and accessed by users who want to read or learn from them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main difference between a DataLake and a DataWarehouse is the level of organization and structure. A DataLake is good for storing large amounts of raw data, while a DataWarehouse is better for storing structured data that is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-does-a-data-scientist-do\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1276\">ready for analysis<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pros of using a DataLake are that it can store any type of data, it&#8217;s scalable, and it&#8217;s relatively inexpensive. The cons are that it requires more effort to access and analyze the data, and it can be difficult to ensure data quality and consistency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pros of using a DataWarehouse are that it provides fast and easy access to structured data, it ensures data quality and consistency, and it supports business intelligence activities. The cons are that it can be more expensive, it requires more effort to set up and maintain, and it may not be suitable for storing unstructured data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, whether you choose to use a DataLake or a DataWarehouse depends on your needs. If you need to store large amounts of raw data and you don&#8217;t mind putting in the effort to access and analyze it, a DataLake might be a good choice. If you need fast and easy access to structured data for reporting and analysis, a DataWarehouse might be a better choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.

How does a Data Warehouse work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key principles of a Data Warehouse is a process known as<strong> Extract. Transform. Load<\/strong> (more commonly known by its acronym, <strong>ETL<\/strong>). This is the core process for working with all the raw information that comes from different sources and ends up in a Data Warehouse (and sometimes a Data Lake) in a much more organized and clean manner. But&#8230;what does each phase of ETL include?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Extraction<\/strong>: This is the process of collecting data from different sources, such as databases, files, or web services. The data can be structured, which means that it has a predefined format and organization, or unstructured, which means that it does not have a predefined format and organization. For example, a structured data source could be a spreadsheet with customer information, and an unstructured data source could be a social media post with customer feedback.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Transformation<\/strong>: This is the process of cleaning, transforming, and integrating the data from different sources. The data is cleaned to remove any errors, inconsistencies, or duplicates. The data is transformed to match the format and structure of the data warehouse. The data is integrated to combine data from different sources into a single, consistent data set. For example, the data from the spreadsheet and the social media post could be cleaned, transformed, and integrated to create a single data set with customer information and feedback.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Loading<\/strong>: This is the process of loading the data into the data warehouse. The data is loaded into tables, which are collections of data organized by rows and columns. The tables are organized into schemas, which are groups of tables that share a common theme or purpose. The schemas are organized into layers, which are levels of abstraction or detail of the data. For example, the data set with customer information and feedback could be loaded into a table called Customer, which belongs to a schema called Marketing, which belongs to a layer called Business.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the ETL process, it is crucial how we provide access to the information that we finally have in a structured and organized manner in the Data Warehouse. This is known as &#8220;Data Access&#8221;. It is not a part of the ETL process itself, which is focused on transforming &#8220;raw&#8221; information into something more easily consumable. However, it is still vital to fully leverage the data stored in the Data Warehouse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Access<\/strong>: This is the process of accessing and analyzing the data in the data warehouse. The data is accessed by using queries, which are requests for specific information or calculations from the data. The queries are written in a language called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-is-sql\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1755\">SQL<\/a>, which stands for <strong>Structured Query Language<\/strong>. The queries are executed by a software called a query engine, which processes the queries and returns the results. The results are presented in a format called a report, which can be a table, a chart, a dashboard, or any other visual representation of the data. For example, a query could be written to find out the average customer satisfaction score for a product, and the result could be presented in a bar chart.
