For years the media has focused on coding as a path chosen separately from traditional careers. However, many of those representations date back to before the widespread usage of the Internet rose in the 1990s, and today\u2019s workforce is a very different place.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nowadays, there are a growing number of careers where being a coder is not just a good addition to your resume, but even essential for \u201ckeeping up with the Joneses\u201d. From the corporate world to public education, government to the hospitality industry, coding knowledge can unlock a whole suite of useful job benefits, which is drawing more and more career workers to online coding classes to build out their skill set.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what careers benefit the most from a knowledge of coding? How can you increase your chances for job success (and promotions and raises, among other things) by choosing to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">learn to code<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> while working in careers that are rapidly being shaped by programming knowledge? Here are 10 jobs where you can stand out from the crowd if you know how to code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/api.sololearn.com\/Uploads\/10_Jobs_Where_You_Stand_Out_From_The_Crowd_If_You_Know_How_To_Code_blog_02.png\" alt=\"\u201c10\"><\/p>\n<h2><strong>#1: Marketing&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As our recent exploration of how PHP is shaping modern marketing explored, knowing how to code while working for a marketing company isn\u2019t just a nice idea &#8212; it\u2019s being actively sought out by some of the biggest players in the industry. From knowing how to manipulate databases to truly measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, to being able to create your own dynamic advertisements and outreach campaigns and wire them with analytics software, modern marketing professionals are turning to coding more and more these days.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>#2: Finance and Investing&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The days of traders shouting on the floor are not quite gone, but as the rise of bitcoin and blockchain technology have shown, the modern financial and investing world has fully embraced all that programming can offer. From designing new financial modeling software, to capturing real-time data to calculate investment risk or long-term profit margins, financial professionals with coding knowledge can avoid overpaying for proprietary technology and instead build their own software solutions. Major firms like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.csestack.org\/goldman-sachs-online-coding-test-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goldman Sachs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have been actively hiring more and more programmers in recent years to do just that.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>#3: Transportation&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gone are the days of a gravelly-voiced dispatcher communicating with trucks or buses from a central office over a CB radio. Instead, modern transportation companies rely on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.samsara.com\/pages\/fleet-management?utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=fleet_management_cpa_450&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_content=e&amp;utm_term=fleet%20management%20software&amp;utm_ext_ad_id=kwd-13772922&amp;utm_ext_adset_id=74746217191&amp;utm_ext_campaign_id=2038522922&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwqvyFBhB7EiwAER786Tib9pqFuDX3rh55_GLg4sl4KHDqunGmmtpSJ27YYVephsi-Ukf5HBoCbL8QAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cutting-edge software<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can offer real-time GPS updates on vehicles, calculate repair schedules and costs to keep the maximum number of vehicles running safely, and optimize travel routes on the fly to deal with changing weather and traffic conditions. Fleet managers who can design or improve their own fleet management software have a significant leg up on rival companies who are still using paper charts and radio communications, and thus take on bigger (and more) clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>#4: Education&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The COVID-19 pandemic showed the world just how much the education system was begging for a technological revolution &#8212; but the smartest teachers were already building their own classroom management and assessment software even before the pandemic began. From building plugins to integrate with common tools like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/classroom.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Classroom<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blackboard.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blackboard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to designing discussion software to help students engage with course concepts or connect to their classes from any location, coding-savvy teachers have stayed ahead of the curve by building their own solutions to common classroom needs and problems from scratch.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>#5: Human Resources&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HR professionals have long needed to stay on top of mountains of constantly changing data &#8212; from onboarding and offboarding employees who may be working at dozens of different locations around the globe, to tracking financial and benefits information and disbursements, to staying on top of an ever-shifting payroll. That\u2019s why smart HR professionals are <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/Courses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">learning to code<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to design their own software solutions from the ever-growing network of responsibilities as an HR manager. With liability and financial responsibilities that are greater than most other senior-level employees at a company, a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shrm.org\/resourcesandtools\/hr-topics\/technology\/pages\/hr-increasingly-seeks-employees-who-can-code.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coding-savvy HR professional<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can streamline a company\u2019s housekeeping and bookkeeping operations into a single innovative software platform.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>#6: Tourism&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People don\u2019t think of tourism as a field where coding skills can be a huge benefit, but with the rise of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/99\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR and VR technology<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in recent years, there may be no better field for professionals to start taking some coding classes. Tourism hotspots are now <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fluentu.com\/blog\/travel\/best-tourism-apps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">developing unique apps<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for their cities or locations, which can allow anything from QR-code scanned entry or online ticketing to immersive tour experiences that can be accessed anywhere in the world. As \u201csmart cities\u201d become more and more of a norm around the globe, tourist officials who can build software to play off the digital infrastructure of their city can help bring in valuable tourist money at a greater level than ever before.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>#7: Event Industry&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The days of paper invitations, lost RSVP cards, mailing entry tickets, and seating charts drawn on legal pads are all rapidly disappearing. Many innovative event professionals have realized that coding can help them build dynamic, 21st century solutions that solve many of the former headaches of planning and organizing an event. Whether you simply want to check people in for attendance purposes, or organize and communicate with a giant guest list of people, creating a proprietary event management app has become a boon for leading event industry companies like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EventBrite<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/rsvpify.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RSVPify<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and others.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>#8: Sports Medicine And Health&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look no further than some of the biggest professional and collegiate athletics programs and where they are investing their limited resources these days. Many leading athletic training facilities, fitness centers, and athletic teams now use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.medica-tradefair.com\/en\/News\/Interviews\/Previous_Interviews\/Interviews_2020\/Sports_medicine_software_Monitoring_at_the_push_of_a_button\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">innovative apps and software<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to measure athletic progress, recovery from injuries, and to develop training programs that incorporate a variety of data points from an individual to build a specifically tailored approach that works for them. That\u2019s why more and more sports medicine and health professionals are adding coding skills to their repertoire, to meet the rising demands from companies and organizations in this field.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>#9: Hospitality&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.grubhub.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GrubHub<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.exploretock.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tock<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.doordash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DoorDash<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8212; in just a few years time, apps like these and others have transformed the once-traditional restaurant industry by leaps and bounds. Now, a restaurant without its own online ordering system or communications platform is becoming a dinosaur, and hospitality teams are adding skilled coders at a quicker rate than ever before.
