S National Bureau of Statistics<\/a>, there is a high demand for data analysts and that demand is increasing every year. Data analysts might even make around $59000 to $167,000 a year.\u00a0 When they get promoted, they make an average of $95000 a year.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is a data analyst?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A data analyst retrieves data and uses the details for a particular task. Just like a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/3-languages-you-should-know-to-become-a-website-developer\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1998\">web developer<\/a> or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-does-a-software-engineer-do\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1272\">software engineer<\/a>, a data analyst is another career in tech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A data analyst collects, cleans, manipulates and analyzes data collected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put, a data analyst is someone who works with data, either by producing or reproducing the data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What sort of data is collected by a data analyst?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples might include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>How many homes do not have access to electricity in a community?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>How many children have dropped out of school in a particular state?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Why?&nbsp; One reason might be improving a product.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Facebook might want to find out the why and how to improve Facebook and improve it for people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a Facebook data analyst would collect data of young people who use other social media apps but do not use Facebook, analyze the data and present it to the Facebook team for improvement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What do you need to do if you want to become a data analyst?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two types of skills you need, namely, technical skills and soft skills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technical skills are the abilities, knowledge or expertise you need to perform specific, job-related tasks. Without them, you can\u2019t do the work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soft skills are the abilities you have to build a good relationship with the people in your workplace.

It is like an advanced version of Excel.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It can query and compile large data that other spreadsheets cannot compile. Because of the high efficiency of SQL, it is one of the key requirements in job posts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data analysts with a knowledge of SQL have a higher chance of getting a job than others. Check out our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/learn\/courses\/sql-introduction\">SQL course<\/a> if you want to start learning it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data Visualization:-<\/strong> As a good data analyst, it is important to represent your data using graphs and other illustrations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans are visual creatures. If you wish to make it easier for business decision-makers and colleagues on a team to understand your findings, you need to use graphical illustrations like charts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data analysts use data visualization tools like Matplotlib to create charts and graphs to explain data findings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-is-python-used-for\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1222\">Python<\/a>:-<\/strong> Python is a programming language used by data analysts to analyze large, complex data sets.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Python is a key to getting hired. This skill is an industry standard that is required in most job postings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The language has useful libraries that could be useful in predicting accurate analysis. Python is easier to learn than other coding languages. That\u2019s why it\u2019s usually the first language learned by students looking to jump into data analysis.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For absolute beginners, we have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/learn\/courses\/python-introduction\">Python For Beginners<\/a> course that will give you the basic knowledge of fundamentals in python, and you can build fun python projects with it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For intermediate level, we offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/learn\/courses\/python-intermediate\">Python Core<\/a> course that covers important in-depth topics in python and strengthens your python skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the advanced level, we offer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/learning\/1159\">Python For Data Science<\/a>.
