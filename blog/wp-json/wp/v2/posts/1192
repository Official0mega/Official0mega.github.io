The language was designed primarily to offer a solution that could handle exception handling, as well as one that could interface with the Amoeba system. In more simple terms, Python was designed to offer more versatility for the rising demands of programming, especially as the web became more ubiquitous in homes and offices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2000, a 2.0 version was released, adding additional features, followed by a 3.0 version in 2008, which included utilities that allowed for more easily updating Python 2.0 code to 3.0 processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>So why should I learn Python?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python\u2019s popularity is largely drawn from several key features and characteristics of the language, specifically:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simple and clear code: Readability and clarity are the hallmarks of Python, with such features as English keywords instead of punctuation. This ability lets you use Python to create custom applications without writing additional code, saving time and effort.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Support for multiple programming paradigms (both object oriented and structured programming), which makes the language ideal for developing large or more complex software applications<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management, also with an eye toward making complex or large applications easier to produce<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broad and deep standard library, offering a variety of modules for various programming needs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compatible with most major operating systems and platforms<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Allows you to simplify what could otherwise be complex software development<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are plenty of other benefits, but it might be best to think of Python as the \u201cSwiss Army Knife\u201d of programming languages. While other languages may be more convenient or effective for specific use cases, if you commit to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/Course\/Python\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">learning Python<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a wide range of potential work or creative opportunities will open up for you to pursue.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How long does it take to learn Python?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of factors that go into learning any programming language, not just Python &#8212; such as previous experience with other coding languages, access to technology and resources, and comfort level with programming concepts. This makes the answer to \u201cHow long does it take to learn Python?\u201d a bit more complicated than a single easy timeframe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the general consensus is that it is certainly reasonable to expect being able to learn most of the ins and outs of using Python within two months if you apply yourself and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/Course\/Python\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">choose an effective Python coding course<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help build out your abilities and knowledge base.
