In the 1970s and 1980s, well before the internet had become a household mainstay for average Americans, popular gaming systems like the Atari and Nintendo consoles and games like Pong and Space Invaders drew legions of fans around the world. By the end of the 1980s, many families had a gaming console under their TV at home.<\/p>\n<p>While games (just like computer consoles and the Internet) today have evolved far beyond the imaginations of even their earliest aficionados, the science behind designing and video games remains based on a fundamental building block &#8212; programming languages. From the graphics and sound effects that immerse you in the world of the game, to the menus and user interfaces that let you take control of characters or build new worlds, every element of a video game is a result of painstaking coding and design work behind the scenes.<\/p>\n<p>Today, game development is supported by a variety of popular programming languages, with certain languages being more useful and applicable than others depending on the vision of the finished product. Because of the continued popularity of gaming worldwide, jobs for video game programmers and designers remain plentiful, provided you have the right skill set to help turn drawings and flow charts into an interactive experience that users will enjoy.<\/p>\n<p>So how do you begin your career as a video game programmer? What are the essential programming languages used to make video games today? In this guide, we will explore some of the more popular and robust languages in use today, as well as some helpful hints for how to improve your own experience and start building your own games (or helping others to build their ideas) as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/api.sololearn.com\/Uploads\/Programming_Languages_Used_To_Make_Video_Games_Blog_2.jpg\" alt=\"\"><\/p>\n<h2><strong>You Need To Know The Difference Between Web Programming and Systems Programming<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assuming you are already a video game fan, you know that most games today are offered either through specific gaming consoles (like the PlayStation, Xbox, or even your PC or laptop) or through your smartphone or web browser. Programming for consoles (which are suites of hardware specifically tailored for gaming, although they can be used for other things) is often referred to as systems programming.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, games that operate directly through your browser or through apps on a smartphone fall under the heading of web programming &#8212; since the games are directly tied into a web browser or the application\u2019s code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what\u2019s the main difference? Well, games designed through systems programming are often significantly more complex (and thus, offer significantly more features and a more immersive gaming experience) due to the capabilities of the consoles that support them. Browser games are often more simplistic, which makes them remarkably similar to the early forerunners of the industry, like Pong, which relied on limited user controls and graphics. However, as web-based programming languages have continued to evolve, many browser games now can offer remarkably intricate graphics and user features, far beyond their predecessors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Programming Languages Are Most Popular for Systems Programming<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given the significant demands for graphics, audio, user controls, and interactivity of modern systems-based video games, it\u2019s no surprise that the key programming languages used to make video games for systems need to be robust and offer significant customization and abilities. However, a few languages stand out among the rest as the top choices among experienced video game developers and designers:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/Course\/CPlusPlus\/\"><strong>C++<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many consider C++ to be the gold standard for systems programming. Originally released in 1985, C++ has undergone decades of updates, variations, and reimaginings, often driven by the needs of programmers for new features. While C++ is not the easiest <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/Courses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">language to learn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the language is widely praised for its advanced capabilities (such as memory management). Despite the learning curve, it continues to reign as one of the most popular choices in coding today. Apart from the appeal of its features and functionality, the popularity of C++ is also widely attributed to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/game-ace.com\/unreal-game-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unreal Engine<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an incredibly popular game engine known to practically anyone (it is very likely, if you are an avid gamer, that you\u2019ve experienced this engine yourself). Another significant advantage of C++ is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.cppreference.com\/w\/cpp\/links\/libs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">abundance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of libraries and frameworks available to simplify the development process. Some of the most popular games developed using C++ include <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.counter-strike.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counterstrike<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/starcraft2.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starcraft<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/worldofwarcraft.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">World of Warcraft<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/Course\/CSharp\/\"><strong>C#<\/strong><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known as C Sharp, C# is both a more recent addition to the programming world (released in 2000 by Microsoft) as well as an easier option for beginning coders to learn. While it draws heavily from languages like Java and C++ that preceded it, C# still has some unique elements of its own that differentiates it. The release of C# is closely tied to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dotnet.microsoft.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.NET Framework<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which debuted alongside the language. The .NET framework offers developers all of the tools to develop web applications and other solutions. While it lacks the speed of C++ and doesn\u2019t offer as many features to its developers, it is also significantly easier for a new video game programmer to learn. Perhaps the biggest claim to fame for C# is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/game-ace.com\/unity-game-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a dedicated C#-based engine that is nearly as popular and widely used as the Unreal Engine. Some of the most popular games built with C# include <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/playhearthstone.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hearthstone<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pokemongolive.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pokemon Go<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/Course\/Java\/\"><strong>Java<\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the foundational languages of programming in general, aside from video games, Java has been a language in constant evolution since its initial creation in 1991. These days, it remains one of the most popular languages worldwide, driven largely by its ever-growing variety of use cases. In terms of video game programming, the single biggest factor behind Java\u2019s popularity is its near-universal compatibility. Specifically, Java code can be converted into generic bytecodes that can be executed on any system. Some of the most popular games developed using Java include <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassin%27s_Creed_II\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assassin&#8217;s Creed II<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.runescape.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Runescape<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Wars_Galaxies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Star Wars Galaxies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>What Programming Languages Are Most Popular for Web-Based Games<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web-based games have largely been created through the useful combination of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/Course\/HTML\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HTML5<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/Course\/JavaScript\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Javascript<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As the two primary languages for many browsers and browser-based applications, this makes sense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, some industry experts <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/w3techs.com\/technologies\/details\/cp-javascript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estimate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that Javascript is used on 95% of all websites (and considering the pure number of websites worldwide, this is an even more impressive accomplishment). Thus, it should not be surprising that it is also the main coding language used for web games. Javascript is designed to be accessible on a wide variety of devices and platforms, and quite easy to learn if you are already familiar with C# and C++.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Of course, implementing a web page with a Javascript game is not possible using JS alone, as you also need HTML5 or another webpage format. HTML5 is the most modern globally-accepted standard for web page content, and Javascript running on an HTML5 page is the most common combination you will find for titles played through a web browser.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Other Game Development Languages and Tech You Should Know<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of you who have experimented with virtual reality technology like the Oculus Rift, you know that the newest frontier for game development will be those geared toward headsets and this field. While the games that operate on these hardware sets are often designed using similar languages (for example, virtual reality and augmented reality titles are typically developed on C++ or C#), there are some obvious intricacies to the hardware that make developing for these platforms a bit different than traditional consoles. There are also other languages, like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/Course\/Python\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, that were once widely used for game development, but have fallen a bit by the wayside as the languages we\u2019ve highlighted here have gained more popularity and a wider following.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Do You Learn How To Program For Video Games?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you decided that you want to build video games as your dream career?
