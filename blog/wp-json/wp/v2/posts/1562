We\u2019re looking forward into giving some light into the subject so that you can decide whether \u201cbusiness intelligence\u201d is the thing for you!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the basics: what exactly is \u201cbusiness intelligence\u201d? And of what use can it be to you, if <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/the-coding-skills-you-need-for-a-career-in-it\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1508\">you\u2019re into coding<\/a>?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its early stages, \u201cbusiness intelligence\u201d will require you to put some coding skills to use, either in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/learn\/courses\/sql-introduction\">SQL<\/a> (commonly used for database information retrieving), <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/learn\/languages\/python\">Python<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/learning\/1147\">R<\/a> (commonly used for processing). But hey, fear not little Padawan, here at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/home\">Sololearn<\/a> we\u2019ve got you covered with courses on all of them to help you raise up to the challenge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of \u201cBusiness Intelligence\u201d comes down to giving business owners deep (and very much needed) insights into their own businesses! And how is this achieved? By gathering data, analyzing it, and providing insights, that can get them either an edge over their competition, or even an idea of where business is headed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because business intelligence is all about context (and what kind of company would we be running if we didn\u2019t give you some?). But before we go deeper into the subject: a brief history lesson!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The History behind the Business (Intelligence)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think business intelligence is a new concept? Not quite. It\u2019s actually been around for ages.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term was first coined in 1868, by an author named Richard Devens, who cited a banker who collected intelligence (i.e. information) to get an edge over other competitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the concept evolved, starting thanks to IBM in the late 50s &#8211; when they first considered the potential of tech to gather business information -.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evolution is an unstoppable force (and not limited to monkeys or people), and so by the 60s and 70s the first decision support systems (DSS) were created. And \u201cwhat are DSSs?\u201d you might ask? They are interactive information systems that help <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/excel-vs-python-data-analysis\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"2365\">analyze large volumes of data<\/a> (to help cope with the ever-expanding amounts of information that gets gathered).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, \u201cbusiness intelligence\u201d has gotten more refined and more accessible, due to becoming less complicated to interact with. <strong>But let\u2019s get back to Business (<\/strong><strong><em>Intelligence<\/em><\/strong><strong>)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Waze or Google Maps, we\u2019re more than happy to show you the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does business intelligence work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Business Intelligence makes use of plenty of well-known tidbits of technology that give companies a broader picture of their current status.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cData mining\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cProcess analysis\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cBenchmarking\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cQuerying\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cData visualization\u201d<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cData preparation\u201d.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are big words, used to describe even bigger \u2013 and more complex \u2013 processes, but that ultimately translate into an elementary and straightforward thing: measuring and analyzing collected user and logistics data to paint a bigger (and more colorful) picture of the state of affairs within the business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is business intelligence used for?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be used in virtually every department, holding numerous processes and tools that help to improve the many workflow processes within the company, ranging from security, to marketing, hiring, inventory, supply chain and even employee performance!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Business intelligence hides in plain sight, as there are plenty of well-known companies that count on it every single day to improve both themselves, and the way they serve their users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coca-Cola makes use of its high number of followers on social media along with image recognition AI, to tell when photos of their products are being posted, which in turn provides them with profound insights about whom, why, and how they mention the brand!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know how Netflix always seems to know exactly what you want to see? It should come as no surprise as to how this is achieved: by using the power of business intelligence! That, along with its 148 million subscriber database, give the company insights into what you intend to see, and when you would like to see it, providing highly efficient, targeted, content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uber has disrupted the way we order a cab nowadays, and this owes itself (in part) to business intelligence. It is used on multiple aspects of their business structure, but a very straightforward example of this has to do with how their \u201cdynamic rates\u201d work. These ever-changing values are not random: they are actually set based on data that has been collected on things such as driver availability, customer demand, traffic and journey times, and analyzed with business intelligence!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it\u2019s applications are varied, the greater purpose of business intelligence is to make everything run as smoothly as possible by understanding how everything is running, by spotting inefficiencies and issues and correcting them before they become a real problem!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with this, can come even bigger ROIs. Who doesn\u2019t like that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is business intelligence really for me?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you won\u2019t \u2013 <em>necessarily<\/em> &#8211; get to mingle with the whatsits of Hollywood, or be part of the \u2013 aforementioned \u2013 sexy world of international espionage, you will be able to make a difference within the tight fabric of many companies, leaving your mark while helping them grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how can you know if this is a fit for you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is presenting insights concisely your strong suit?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Do you have a knack for solving problems?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enjoy critical thinking?<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Okay, with working on your own, or as part of a bigger team to analyze and implement new software?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If most of your answers to these questions were \u201cyes\u201d, then you\u2019re on the right path!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What will I get to do with business intelligence?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that\u2019s something only you can know!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we\u2019re more than happy to give you a little bit of insight into what you can expect \u2013 just in case you decide this is something you\u2019d be interested in pursuing<em> <\/em>-, doing exciting and dazzling activities such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Monitoring and optimizing data collection<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Making sure that data is correctly gathered, stored, and analyzed<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reporting your data findings.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Actual mining for minerals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok the last one was a joke, but you get the point!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PART OF THE UMBRELLA OF BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other big concepts that fall under the \u201cbusiness intelligence\u201d umbrella and that are very relevant to today\u2019s culture, with things like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/a-guide-to-data-science-machine-learning-deep-learning-and-artificial-intelligence\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1430\">automation &amp; AI <\/a>or data collection complementing and bringing new and even more complex levels of detail and relevance\u00a0 to the data generated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, automation &amp; AI can both be used to further streamline the process of data analysis, by giving out exponentially more complex estimates that provide even greater insights, far more than humans ever could!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the endless amounts of data that get collected every single day, along with the help of our good friend, \u201cbusiness intelligence\u201d, businesses can extract even more accurate conclusions than ever before, making the role of collected data bigger than ever before!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BUT WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn\u2019t just apply to Spiderman.
