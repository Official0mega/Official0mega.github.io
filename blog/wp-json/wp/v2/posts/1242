Create software, browsers or operating systems? Do you want to use a language that lets you create powerful, yet like programs? Then you need C++.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Developers use C++ for general-purpose programming, including building software and doing scientific calculations. It\u2019s also used in many other general-purpose tasks in the software industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s why C++ is known as a general-purpose language. In other words, someone can take C++ as both a low-level &amp; high-level language. It means that C++ can work closely with hardware resources, unlike <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/c-plus-plus-or-c-sharp\/\">C#<\/a> and Java.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also efficient when handling the memory of electronic devices. Therefore, it\u2019s popular for developing embedded applications and IoT devices. Embedded applications are software applications used in consumer electronic devices. An example of embedded systems is automatic washing machines. An example of IoT devices is smartwatches.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what can you do with C++? And what are its advantages over other languages?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main features of C++<\/span><\/h2>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C++ is an Object-oriented supported language<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C programming language uses functional programming to write codes.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is function programming? It means you are writing your code as a collection of functions. Yet, there <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> some downsides to it: developers can\u2019t really express or represent real-world objects with functions.\u00a0 This is where Object-Oriented programming (OOP) comes to play. C++ is an object-oriented programming language.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classes and objects are the main building blocks of Object-oriented programming(OOP). Usually, we create these classes around real-world concepts. Thus, OOP allows you to code interactions between real-world objects easily.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In OOP, your program will be a set of separate classes. Most of these classes can act as independent entities. Thus, OOP lets you create more modularized code compared to procedural programming.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C++ is fast<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C++ takes less time to compile and execute code than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/best-programming-languages\/\">other general-purpose languages<\/a>. A C++ compiler will directly convert the source code into machine-readable code. Thus, C++ allows fast compilation and execution of applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C++ has a wide range of library support<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C++ has broad external library support, bringing tremendous capabilities to your project.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Standard Template Library is called STL. It simplifies coding by providing useful data structures. Some examples of data structures are tables, hashes, sets, maps, lists, and arrays. C++ provides many other libraries for different use cases besides these standard libraries. The following list includes a few of them.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pocoproject.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">POCO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> C++ Library is a cross-platform library used to perform file system operations.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standard File System library<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.openssl.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OpenSSL<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> library brings you cryptographic operations and applies TLS protocols to your applications.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sqlite.org\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SQLite<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a full-featured database engine that allows integrating databases with your application.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/nlohmann\/json\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JSON for modern C++<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> enables working with JSON objects in C++<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better performance\u00a0<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pointers and references are powerful features in C++\u00a0 compared to other programming languages. They allow you to divide memory dynamically so you can better manage RAM. This directly affects the performance of the application.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C++ can work closely with hardware resources<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a low-level language, C++ can closely communicate and work with hardware resources. Thus it is easy to manage memory and handle multi-threaded executions. Furthermore, it offers better processing speed while executing applications.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many industries use C++ for their products. Now let&#8217;s discuss several use cases of C++ and how it is used.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is C++ used for\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operating systems (OS)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Operating systems must be fast and capable of managing system resources efficiently. Generally, users can see an operating system as a graphical user interface. Yet, the OS does a lot more behind the scenes.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">handles Input\/Output(IO) operations<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stores and finds files on the hard drive<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allocates memory and handles garbage\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">executes software applications installed on top of the OS<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">supports executing user-written programs and multimedia applications<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">supports peripheral devices, IoT devices, and many others<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">manages resources efficiently<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often operating systems do the above tasks simultaneously. This requires multi-threading to a great extent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why the code of an OS needs to be written in an efficient programming language. Unsurprisingly, many OS&#8217;s use C++ as their base language. Some popular examples are\u00a0 Ubuntu, Linux, Windows, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/top-10-reasons-to-become-an-ios-developer\/\">IOS<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game development<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game developers have used C++ in the gaming industry for a long time. They use C++ to develop different types of 2D and 3D game engines and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-is-an-api\/\">gaming APIs<\/a>. Games load many objects within a few seconds and these objects communicate with each other during the gameplay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lagging means a negative user experience and bad reviews. That&#8217;s why minimum latency is a major consideration in game development. C++ is capable of efficiently running complex programs and it&#8217;s close to machine language compared to other high-level languages. So C++ can handle hardware-related operations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you a gamer? The following games and game engines use C++:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Counterstrike,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unity engine,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unreal Engine,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the world of warcraft,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Game consoles like PlayStation and Xbox<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AR\/VR applications<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual reality is getting more popular. Gaming is the most widespread VR application worldwide, and Unity and Unreal are the most popular game engines for VR gaming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VR and AR applications manage large amounts of data from camera sensors. 3D environments are created in your VR pod based on object movements. It requires fast execution and memory management from the VR device. So C++ is perfect for delivering an excellent virtual experience to users.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Databases<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most software applications and organizations use databases to keep track of their data. A large amount of data is stored and handled in databases. The speed of databases is directly proportional to the performance of an application. Therefore data creation and data handling processes need to be efficient. C++ is used to create both relational and non-relational (NoSQL) databases. Some examples of databases written in C++ include:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-is-sql\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MySQL<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PostgreSQL<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MongoDB<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Internet Of Things(IoT)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smart applications play a huge role in our lives today by automating tasks.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some use cases of IoT devices are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">smart watches,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TVs,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">home appliances,<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vehicle appliances<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">medical devices<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the above&#8217;s applications are written in C++ because it can handle I\/O operations quickly. It can efficiently communicate with sensors, robotics components, and external devices. Plus C++ can work closely with hardware components like memory and CPU.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Web browsers<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hate lagging or freezing web pages on the internet? Most popular web browsers are developed in C++ to prevent that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some notable examples are\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Chrome\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mozilla Firefox\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opera<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safari<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, C++ provides an optimal browsing experience by loading interactive web pages quickly. It is possible since C++ gets information from databases with minimal delays.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banking\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banking systems usually process millions of transactions daily. Their systems need to handle simultaneous processes so many financial institutes still use C++.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason for that is C++ executes programs with low memory access. Besides, it is harder to attack applications developed in low-level languages like C and C++. Thus, C++ provides a new layer of security for these applications. Infosys is a famous banking application developed using C++.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graphics<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Graphical applications and tools need a lot of computer resources.

It enables filmmakers to add rich graphics and animations to movies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flight Software<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C++ is used for building flight software for commercial airplanes and military aircraft. An efficient language is needed to model, test, and stimulate flight capabilities. Defense contractors use C++ for that purpose as it is good at it. A few examples are F-16s and F-35s.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Airplanes also require such software as pilots often train using flight simulators. Famous airlines use flight control systems developed with C++. C++ is also used for building aircraft safety and performance software. This software performs tasks like optimizing wing design and reducing drag.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety is a critical feature of this kind of software. Thus, the development is highly regulated to meet the necessary safety standards. Developers have to follow strict coding standards when developing. These exacting standards make C++ an attractive choice for developing flight software. It ensures that the features of planes work constantly and predictably during flights.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Distributed Computing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C++ is popular for developing distributed systems. A distributed system is a system whose components are spread across multiple computers. These computers\u00a0 communicate with each other (think of banking systems and social media networks that use several servers to host them) . So if one server goes down, the whole application won\u2019t break.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason for that is its excellent support for multi-threading. C++ is lightweight and executes codes extremely fast. So, distributed system frameworks like XGboost, Redis, Caffe, and TensorFlow use C++ programs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both the IT and electronic industries use C++ <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heavily<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
