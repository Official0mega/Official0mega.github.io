If you are considering starting a new career in data science, at one point you will need to learn how to code.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Programming is crucial in every data role. Whether you are performing exploratory data analysis, visualizing data to find hidden patterns, or building a machine learning model to predict housing prices next year. Everything is done with programming.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>But what exactly is programming?&nbsp;<\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a technique that allows tasks to be executed in a computer system. Or more simply put, to communicate with computers, we use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/best-programming-languages\/\">programming languages<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are hundreds of programming languages out there. You can think of a programming language as a toolbox designed to create, fix, and analyze things in the digital world. Building a house is not the same as performing a medical operation. Each activity requires a completely different set of tools. The same thing applies in the digital world: depending on the task and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-is-a-domain-name\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"2655\">domain <\/a>at hand, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/write-programming-language\/\">some programming languages will work better than others.\u00a0<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><b>What languages do you need for data science?&nbsp;<\/b><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the field of data science, the two most popular programming languages are Python and R. Both languages are well suited for any data science tasks you may think of. It\u2019s very common to hear about \u201cPython vs R\u201d, which suggests the idea that you have to choose either <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-is-python-used-for\/\">Python<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/what-is-r\/\">R<\/a>. That may be true for beginners, but the question that matters is how to make the best use of both languages for your specific use case.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what makes R and Python the perfect candidates for data science? We will also study the main differences between Python and R and will provide some factors to consider to choose the right language for your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is Python?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python is a general-purpose, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/python-data-types\/\">open-source programming language<\/a> that can be used for various applications, including software development, gaming, and data analysis.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Launched in 1991, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, occupying the top position in several programming language popularity indices, such as the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tiobe.com\/tiobe-index\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TIOBE<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Index and the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pypl.github.io\/PYPL.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PYPL<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Index.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popularity is closely associated with the community size of a programming language. And here Python is unbeatable. Python is backed by a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/1241923\/worldwide-software-developer-programming-language-communities\/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20survey%2C%20the,programmers%2C%20with%2010.1%20million%20developers.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vast community<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of users and developers, who ensure the smooth growth and development of the language.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python is an easy language to read and write due to its high similarity with human language. In fact, high readability and interpretability are at the heart of the design of Python. For these reasons, Python is often cited as a go-to programming language for newcomers with no coding experience.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, Python has been gaining popularity in the field of data science thanks to its simplicity and the endless possibilities provided by the hundreds of specialized libraries and packages that support any kind of data science task.

And today it remains one of the most popular analytics tools used in both traditional data analytics and the rapidly-evolving field of business analytics.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">R includes functions that support, to name just a few:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Linear modeling<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-linear modeling&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classical statistics&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classifications<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clustering<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The extensive possibilities R offers are mostly due to its huge community. It has developed one of the richest collections of data-science-related packages. All of them are available via the Comprehensive R Archive Network (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CRAN<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">).<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another feature that made it particularly remarkable was its ability to generate quality reports with support for data visualization and its available frameworks to create interactive web applications.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python vs R: a Comparison<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you\u2019re a little more familiar with Python and R, let&#8217;s compare them from a data science perspective to assess their similarities, strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purpose<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Python and R were created with different purposes \u2013Python as a general purpose programming language, and the R for statistical analysis\u2013, nowadays both are suitable for any data science task. However, Python is considered a more versatile programming language than R, as it\u2019s also extremely popular in other software domains, such as web development, gaming, and blockchain.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Type of Users<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a general-purpose programming language, Python is the standard go-to choice for software developers breaking into data science. Plus, Python\u2019s focus on productivity makes it a more suitable tool to build complex applications. By contrast, R is widely used in academia and certain sectors, such as finance and pharmaceuticals. It is the perfect language for statisticians and researchers with limited programming skills.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learning curve<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Python\u2019s intuitive syntax is considered one of the closest programming languages to English. This makes it a very good language for new programmers, with a smooth and linear learning curve. Although R is designed to run basic data analysis easily and within minutes, things get harder with complex tasks, and it takes more time for R users to master the language. So, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/reasons-to-learn-python\/\">Python is an easier programming language<\/a>, especially for beginners.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popularity<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of popularity, Python has consistently outranked R, especially in recent years. Python ranks first in several programming language popularity indexes. This is due to the widespread use of Python in multiple software domains, including data science. By contrast, R is mostly employed in data science, academia, and certain sectors.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common Libraries<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Python:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/numpy.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NumPy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: provides a large collection of functions for scientific computing.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/pandas.pydata.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pandas<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: perfect for data manipulation.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/matplotlib.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matplotlib<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: the standard library for data visualization.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/scikit-learn.org\/stable\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scikit-learn<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: is a library in Python that provides many machine learning algorithms.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tensorflow.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TensorFlow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: a widely used framework for deep learning.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For R:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/dplyr.tidyverse.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dplyr<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: It is a data manipulation library for R.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/tidyr.tidyverse.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tidyr<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: a great package that will help you get your data clean and tidy.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/ggplot2.tidyverse.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ggplot2<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: the perfect library for visualizing data.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/shiny.rstudio.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shiny<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: It is the ideal tool for creating interactive web apps directly from R.<\/span><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/topepo.github.io\/caret\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caret<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: one of the most important libraries for machine learning in R.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common IDEs<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, enables programmers to consolidate the different aspects of writing a computer program.
