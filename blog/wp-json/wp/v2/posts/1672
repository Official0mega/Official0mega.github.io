CSS codes define the style and appearance of a page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stylesheet contains colors, fonts, and numbers that tell the computer how to display things. <strong>You can create stylesheets using the CSS programming language. <\/strong>You can create your stylesheet from scratch or edit one of the many free ones available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you wanted to change the color of every paragraph on your site to green, you could use CSS to tell your browser to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add an effect to an element, you first need to select it in the HTML code, then apply any CSS properties to it by inserting them between curly braces.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Styling Your Website: Where Does CSS Come In?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts use CSS for many reasons.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your website banner image to be bigger than the rest of your content, you can use CSS to make it so. But it can do much more!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some of its uses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enhancing Site Interaction<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS is a language that describes how elements on your web page will look as<strong> it modifies the way your site responds to user interactions.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, you may want to change the color of an element on your page to make it stand out more. <strong>For instance, if you have a \u201cbuy\u201d button on your page,<\/strong> you might want it to be green instead of black.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With CSS you can change the color value of an element to make it more appealing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Responsiveness<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another function of CSS is to <strong>control how your website looks<\/strong> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sololearn.com\/blog\/responsive-web-design\/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"1725\">works on different screen sizes.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have one screen size, you can use only HTML. But, if you have more than one size (like desktop, laptop, tablet), you need a way to style HTML so that it looks good on all screens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CSS media queries<\/strong> are the solution.

You can have left, right, or center alignments, vertical or horizontal positions, and how far down the page text should appear.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance: Here are some examples of navigation bar positioning you can execute with CSS:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed navigation bar with background and text&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>sidebar\/Vertical navigation bar with background and text&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Horizontal navigation bar with background and text&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who Makes Use Of CSS?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Many websites use CSS code<\/strong> <strong>and not only in the domain of programmers.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some experts who use the CSS code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Web Designers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a language describing how web pages should look and behave.
